# Welcome.

This is my repository for showcasing my personal software projects.

Currently, I'm either working on, or interested in making:
- verse (a compiler)
- air (a cross-assembler)
- GML-like library
- UEFI-compatible OS

These projects, however, won't be documented properly until I believe they are usable enough for my intents and purposes.

# Note to self

`_debug/` is for personal debug purposes only. No files must show up in the website.
Also, use PAT instead of password when pushing the repository.
